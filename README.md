This is an Augmented Reality (AR) iOS Application. It allows users to drop a virtual pin on tables, meeting rooms, and other venues so that other users know that it is occupied. 

It uses Apple's ARKit for AR and a firebase backend. 

This project won the overall prize at Hack&Roll 2018, Singapore's largest hackathon. All the code is free to use for anyone, and pull requests and forks are welcome.
